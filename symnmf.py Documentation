# Clustering and Factorization

This Python script is designed to perform clustering and factorization on input data using the Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) method. The script takes various command-line arguments and operates on a dataset provided as a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python
- numpy
- pandas
- mysymnmfsp (a custom module for SymNMF)

## Usage

You can run the script from the command line as follows:
python script_name.py <number_of_clusters> <method> <input_data_file>
number_of_clusters: An integer specifying the desired number of clusters.
method: A string that specifies the factorization method. The supported values are:
"symnmf" for Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
"sym" for a different factorization method
"ddg" for another factorization method
"norm" for yet another factorization method
input_data_file: The path to a CSV file containing the input data.

Functions
avg_matrix(M)
This function computes the average of the entries in a matrix M.

Parameters:

M: The matrix to compute the average for.
Returns:

The average value of the matrix entries.
create_output(vectors_array)
This function formats and prints the final centroids as output.

Parameters:
vectors_array: A 2D array containing vectors to be printed as centroids.
main()
The main function of the script. It processes command-line arguments, reads the input data, initializes the factorization, and prints the results.

Command-line Arguments
The script checks the command-line arguments to ensure they are provided correctly:

It verifies that the correct number of arguments is provided (4 in this case).

It validates the first argument as a valid integer, representing the number of clusters.

It checks the second argument to determine the factorization method (e.g., SymNMF).

It validates the third argument as a valid input data file (CSV format).

Initialization and Factorization
Depending on the selected factorization method, the script initializes the factorization with random values within certain constraints, computes the factorization, and prints the results.

Running the Script
To use the script, execute it from the command line with the correct number of arguments, specifying the number of clusters, the factorization method, and the input data file.
