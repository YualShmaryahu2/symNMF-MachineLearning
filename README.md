# symNMF-MachineLearning
This project encompasses the deployment of a clustering algorithm rooted in symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (symNMF). Moreover, it includes an evaluation on various datasets, accompanied by a comparative analysis with the K-means algorithm.
Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (symNMF) is a mathematical and computational technique used in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It is a variant of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) specifically designed for symmetric data, such as correlation matrices or data with inherent symmetrical patterns.
In symNMF, the goal is to factorize a given symmetric matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices, typically referred to as the basis and coefficient matrices. These matrices are constrained to contain only non-negative values. The factorization helps uncover underlying patterns and structures within the data, which is particularly useful in tasks like dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and clustering.
